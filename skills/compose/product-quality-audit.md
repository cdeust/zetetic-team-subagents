  When a product "works" per component metrics but the user experience is broken;

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Experience spec (jobs)
1. jobs: define "it just works" criteria for each user contact point (setup, first use, daily use, edge case, error, update).
2. jobs: map integration boundaries. Identify seams visible to the user.
3. jobs: check all quality dimensions simultaneously (ergonomic, functional, robust, performant, beautiful, autonomous, accessible).

### Phase 2: Strip to essential (galileo)
4. galileo: for each feature/element/setting, ask: is this essential to the experience? If not, cut.
5. galileo: identify the minimal model that delivers the core experience.

### Phase 3: Verify (dijkstra)
6. dijkstra: for the remaining essential elements, verify correctness by local reasoning.
7. dijkstra: identify what testing can and cannot cover. Recommend stronger methods for the gaps.

## Output Format

```
## Product Quality Audit: [product/feature]

### Experience spec:
| Contact point | "It just works" criterion | Pass? |
|---|---|---|

### Seam map:
| Boundary | Visible to user? | Fix needed? |
|---|---|---|

### Quality dimensions: [all pass simultaneously? any trade-offs?]
### Edit audit: [elements that don't serve the experience → cut]
### Correctness: [verified by dijkstra? gaps where tests are insufficient?]
### Verdict: [ships / needs work — specific items]
```
