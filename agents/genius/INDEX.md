# Genius Agent Index — Route by Problem Shape

The orchestrator selects genius agents by **problem shape**, not by field or historical person. Each shape is a trigger pattern — a recognizable structure in the problem that activates a specific reasoning procedure. A single agent may serve multiple shapes; a single problem may invoke multiple agents in sequence (see "Pairs well with" in each agent's frontmatter).

> **Rule:** if no shape below matches the problem, do not force a genius agent. Use a standard team agent instead.

## Shape → Agent Lookup

### Measurement, Signal, and Isolation

| Shape | Trigger | Agent | Key move |
|---|---|---|---|
| **residual-with-a-carrier** | measured > predicted from known parts, gap outside noise | [curie](curie.md) | Chase the excess; isolate by enrichment with control substitution |
| **instrument-before-hypothesis** | "we want to improve X" but no instrument reads X | [curie](curie.md) | Fix the instrument and its unit before deciding what to look for |
| **name-the-anomaly** | quantifiable deviation observed, no term for it yet | [curie](curie.md) | Coin a name and operational definition; forbid mechanism talk |
| **two-independent-methods** | a result from one method only | [curie](curie.md) | Require a second independent confirmation before claiming |
| **observer-effect-audit** | measurement may perturb the system (test leakage, Heisenbugs, observability overhead) | [curie](curie.md) | Audit back-action before trusting any measurement |

### Estimation and Bounding

| Shape | Trigger | Agent | Key move |
|---|---|---|---|
| **order-of-magnitude-first** | decision blocked by "we don't have data" | [fermi](fermi.md) | Decompose into bracketable factors; multiply bounds |
| **bracket-before-solve** | false precision masking bad assumptions | [fermi](fermi.md) | Produce a two-sided bound + dominant uncertainty |
| **refuse-false-precision** | single-number estimate presented without bracket | [fermi](fermi.md) | Convert to bracket; name the dominant factor |
| **sanity-check** | a claimed number that nobody has cross-checked | [fermi](fermi.md) | Two independent decompositions must agree to ×10 |
| **feasibility-bound** | "is this even possible?" before committing resources | [fermi](fermi.md) | Bracket the quantity; if the high end is below viability, kill it early |

### Hard Real-Time and Failure Design

| Shape | Trigger | Agent | Key move |
|---|---|---|---|

| **defensive-by-default** | "users will never…" or "our clients always…" | [hamilton](hamilton.md) | Reverse the assumption; software handles the wrong input |

### Defining the Right Measure

| Shape | Trigger | Agent | Key move |
|---|---|---|---|
| **define-the-measure-first** | "improving X" where X has no formal definition | [shannon](shannon.md) | Axiomatize the quantity; derive from properties |
| **limit-before-method** | someone proposes a method without knowing the theoretical limit | [shannon](shannon.md) | Derive the limit; compare current state; decide if method is worth it |
| **source-channel-code-separation** | layers are tangled (data, transport, processing) | [shannon](shannon.md) | Separate into independently-analyzable layers |
| **operational-definition** | a "metric" without a repeatable measurement procedure | [shannon](shannon.md) | Tie the quantity to a limit of a repeatable process |
| **noise-as-parameter** | plan starts with "eliminate the noise" | [shannon](shannon.md) | Characterize the noise; design around it |

### Distributed Systems and Formal Correctness

|---|---|---|---|
| **distributed-causality** | design uses wall-clock time for correctness | [lamport](lamport.md) | Replace "when" with happens-before |
| **proof-before-code** | non-trivial concurrent/distributed code with no written spec | [lamport](lamport.md) | Write the spec; model-check on small instances |
| **invariants-not-traces** | correctness argued by walking through example executions | [lamport](lamport.md) | State the invariant; prove by induction over transitions |
| **spec-first** | team debates behavior by telling stories instead of checking invariants | [lamport](lamport.md) | Write the spec as a predicate; the code refines it |
| **partial-failure-default** | design assumes messages arrive, services respond, disks don't fail | [lamport](lamport.md) | Assume every external interaction can fail in three phases |

### Long-Horizon Observation

| Shape | Trigger | Agent | Key move |
|---|---|---|---|
| **long-horizon-observation** | phenomenon unfolds over weeks/months/years; snapshots will mislead | [darwin](darwin.md) | Start the notebook; match cadence to the phenomenon's timescale |
| **variation-as-data** | variation is being averaged away instead of examined | [darwin](darwin.md) | Look at the distribution, the outliers, the tails |
| **difficulty-book** | theory has no catalog of its own contradicting evidence | [darwin](darwin.md) | Open a difficulty book on day one; every contradiction goes in |
| **hardest-case-first** | theory being defended on its easiest cases | [darwin](darwin.md) | Name the hardest case; address it explicitly before shipping |
| **delay-vs-avoidance** | team delaying past readiness without a stopping rule | [darwin](darwin.md) | Set a forcing function tied to the difficulty book, not to "more confidence" |

### Symmetry and Invariance

| **gauge-vs-global** | "conservation law" claimed from a symmetry — but is it really? | [noether](noether.md) | Classify: global → conservation; local/gauge → identity, not conservation |
| **symmetry-breaking-as-signal** | an expected symmetry is violated | [noether](noether.md) | The breaking is data; localize it to find the perturbation |

### Predictive Taxonomy

| Shape | Trigger | Agent | Key move |

| **explain-to-freshman** | jargon used without the ability to define it in simpler terms | [feynman](feynman.md) | Explain without jargon; the failure points are understanding gaps |
| **cargo-cult-detector** | procedure followed because "successful people do it" without knowing why | [feynman](feynman.md) | Require the causal mechanism; no mechanism = cargo cult candidate |
| **integrity-audit** | a result is suspiciously clean; self-deception possible | [feynman](feynman.md) | List what could invalidate the result; the hardest items go in the report |
| **sum-over-histories** | committed to first plausible explanation without alternatives | [feynman](feynman.md) | Enumerate alternatives; the answer is where multiple lines converge |

| Shape | Trigger | Agent | Key move |
|---|---|---|---|
| **anomaly-others-discarded** | a class of observations is being trimmed, filtered, or labeled noise | [mcclintock](mcclintock.md) | Investigate the discarded class; the anomaly may be the phenomenon |

| **ask-forgiveness-not-permission** | valuable move blocked by process (with bounded risk, demonstrable benefit) | [hopper](hopper.md) | Build first, legitimize after — but only with all four preconditions met |

### Augmentation and Human Capability

| Shape | Trigger | Agent | Key move |
|---|---|---|---|
| **augment-not-automate** | default framing is "automate this" when "augment the person" is ignored | [engelbart](engelbart.md) | Ask what the human uniquely contributes; amplify that |

<token-budget>
## Token Budget Protocol

### Model limits (authoritative)

| Model | Context window | Max output | Session budget (hard cap) | Checkpoint threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Fable 5 | 1,000K | — | 160K | ~120K |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | 1,000K | 128K | 200K | ~180K |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 1,000K | 64K | 200K | ~180K |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | 200K | 64K | 170K | ~120K |

**This agent runs on Opus 5.** Apply the corresponding threshold above.

The session budget is a conservative cap that keeps sessions focused and memory-checkpointed; it is not the model's physical context limit (except for Haiku, whose window IS 200K — the 170K cap leaves headroom for the checkpoint turn itself). Fable 5 caps earlier (160K) because it pays ~2x Opus rates: carrying rent and the 5-minute cache-expiry resume penalty bite twice as hard. The authoritative per-model values live in `~/.claude/ctxguard-thresholds.json`, shared by the Stop guard hook and the session-optimizer statusline; this table mirrors it.

### Checkpoint procedure — trigger at threshold

When your running token estimate reaches the threshold:

**Step 1 — Store state to memory**
```bash
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=genius-INDEX tools/memory-tool.sh create   /memories/genius/checkpoint.md "$(cat <<'CHECKPOINT'
## Checkpoint <ISO-date>

### Task
<one sentence: what the overall task is>

### Completed
- <item 1>
- <item 2>

### In progress
- <item and exact state>

### Remaining
- <item 1>
- <item 2>

### Key decisions made
- <decision and rationale>

### Files modified
- <path>: <what changed>

### Next action
<exact first thing to do on restart>
CHECKPOINT
)"
```

**Step 2 — Signal session end**

End your response with exactly:
```
CHECKPOINT — context cleared.
Resume from: /memories/genius/checkpoint.md
Next action: <copy from checkpoint's "Next action" field>
```

**Step 3 — On restart, recover before anything else**
```bash
# First act — no exceptions
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=genius-INDEX tools/memory-tool.sh view /memories/genius/
# Then load the checkpoint:
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=genius-INDEX tools/memory-tool.sh view /memories/genius/checkpoint.md
```
Read the checkpoint fully before touching any file, tool, or search.

### Memory store rules
- Store **decisions and state**, not code. Code belongs in the repo.
- Keep checkpoint files under 50K (the tool rejects >100K).
- One checkpoint file per task; overwrite it as you progress.
- Cross-session notes (rejected approaches, confirmed constraints) go in a separate `/memories/genius/notes.md`.

### Memory recover rules
- Checkpoint is ground truth. If the checkpoint contradicts your current context, trust the checkpoint.
- Verify file state with `Read` after recovery — don't assume files match what the checkpoint describes.
- If the checkpoint references a file that no longer exists, note the discrepancy and adapt.

### Additional rules
- **Never exceed the threshold in a single session.** Prefer multiple focused sessions.
- **Prefer fast mode** (`/fast`) for Opus 4.8 tasks where peak correctness is not required — 2.5× speed ($10/$50 MTok fast mode vs $5/$25 standard).
- **Output budget**: reserve at least 10K output tokens for your final response. For Opus, headroom is generous (128K). For Sonnet and Haiku (both 64K), avoid sessions where a single long response might exhaust output budget.
- **Complex tasks**: chunk into sub-sessions of ≤150K each; record the chunk plan in memory before starting.
</token-budget>

<mid-task-system-messages>
## Mid-Task System Messages (Opus 4.8 — Research Preview)

**Technical mechanism:** The Messages API now supports `"system"` as a **role inside the conversation history** (not a change to the top-level `system` parameter). Agents can update Claude's instructions mid-task without editing the top-level system prompt — which means the prompt cache stays intact and earlier turns keep hitting cache.

**Why this matters:**
- Cache stays intact: the top-level `system` param never changes, so cached system prompt, tool definitions, and earlier turns all keep hitting the cache. No cache-busting cost.
- Operator channel: `"system"` role messages inside the conversation are recognized by Claude as operator-authored instructions — more reliable and trustworthy than embedding system instructions inside user turns.

### You receive; you do not initiate

Mid-task system messages are injected by the **harness/orchestrator**. The agent receives and obeys them; it cannot send one to itself. This is a developer API feature.

### How to handle a received mid-task system message
1. Treat it as immediately authoritative — it supersedes prior instructions on the same topic.
2. Continue from the current position without re-deriving context (cache is intact).
3. If the update changes task scope or resource budget, record the delta in memory:
   ```bash
   MEMORY_AGENT_ID=<your-id> tools/memory-tool.sh create /memories/<scope>/scope-history.md      "<ISO-date>: received mid-task system message — <what changed>"
   ```
4. If the update contradicts already-completed work, surface the conflict: state what was done under the old instructions and whether outputs need revision.

### How to signal the harness that you NEED a mid-task update
If you discover mid-task that a constraint makes the original task impossible, or a new permission or budget is required, **pause and emit a structured signal** — do not improvise:
```
SCOPE_UPDATE_REQUEST: {
  "reason": "<one sentence>",
  "current_task": "<what you were doing>",
  "blocker": "<what changed or was discovered>",
  "requested_change": "<what you need from the harness>"
}
```
The orchestrator will respond with a mid-task system message (granting or denying).

### What NOT to do
- Do not embed a scope update in a user turn — it bypasses the operator channel and may break caching.
- Do not silently widen your own permissions or budget.
- Do not ignore a received system message — apply it immediately.
</mid-task-system-messages>

<effort-calibration>
## Model Selection & Effort Calibration

### Official model specs (Anthropic, June 2026)

| Model | Context | Max output | Cost (in/out MTok) | Latency | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Opus 4.8 | 1M | **128K** | $5 / $25 | ~77 TPS | Hardest work, peak intelligence, sustained autonomy |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | 1M | **64K** | $3 / $15 | ~72 TPS | Building & iterating — coding workflows, agent prototyping |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | **200K** | **64K** | $1 / $5 | ~109 TPS | Executing pre-planned tasks, latency-sensitive, cost-sensitive |

**Haiku 4.5 hard constraints**: 200K context (= session limit, no slack) and 64K max output. At 136K context consumed only 64K output space remains — the hard ceiling. Haiku checkpoint triggers at ~120K, not 180K. Sonnet and Opus also have 64K max output (Opus: 128K); both run on 1M context so the 200K session budget is a conservative soft cap.

### Which model when (per Anthropic recommendation)

**Use Opus 4.8 when:**
- Long-horizon agent tasks requiring sustained autonomy with minimal oversight
- Deep, complex coding across large codebases
- Cybersecurity work requiring sustained focus across long traces
- Precision enterprise workflows (finance, legal, formal verification)
- Multimodal reasoning

**Use Sonnet 4.6 when:**
- Agent planning & execution (building workflows, not just following them)
- Agile coding — iterating on a feature, not just executing a spec
- Agent prototyping and development cycles
- Production-ready applications
- Efficient research

**Use Haiku 4.5 when:**
- The task has been fully planned by a more capable model and execution is mechanical
- Latency-sensitive path (user-facing, real-time)
- Content generation at scale (ad copy, templating, formatting)
- Efficient research on bounded, well-specified questions

### Effort levels (Opus 4.8 only — controls extended thinking depth)

| Task | Effort | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Reading files, I/O, listing | low | No reasoning required |
| Implementing a fully-specified plan | low | Plan already did the reasoning |
| Bug fix with clear root cause | low–medium | Light application of judgment |
| Architecture decision, PRD | medium | Structured reasoning over bounded search space |
| Multi-disciplinary analysis, research synthesis | medium | Judgment required but not open-ended |
| Formal verification, concurrency proof, security audit | high | Correctness is load-bearing; wrong answer is worse than slow |
| Genuinely stuck / surprising result / blocker | high | Use extended thinking to break impasse |

**Rules:**
- **Never default to high effort** — it is a deliberate escalation, not a fallback.
- **Prefer fast mode** (`/fast`) for Opus 4.8 tasks where peak correctness is not required — 2.5× output speed at same intelligence ($10/$50 MTok fast mode vs $5/$25 standard).
- **Re-evaluate per subtask**: drop effort when a subtask proves simpler than expected; escalate only for that subtask when it proves harder.
- **Token budget interaction**: high effort burns more tokens per turn. Near the 200K session limit, prefer medium/low + checkpoint over burning budget on extended thinking.
- **Cost-aware orchestration**: an opus high-effort turn costs ~50× a haiku turn. Use haiku for parallelizable mechanical subtasks after opus has produced the plan.
</effort-calibration>

<dynamic-workflows>
## Dynamic Workflows — Use Sparingly (Last Resort)

Claude Code dynamic workflows (research preview) run 10s–100s of parallel subagents, check their work, and return a single synthesized result. They are powerful for extraordinarily large tasks but carry **severe token and cost implications**.

### Cost reality
- Each subagent is a full model invocation with its own context load.
- 100 parallel subagents at Sonnet 4.6 = 100× the per-turn cost, plus orchestration overhead.
- Token consumption compounds: every subagent loads the system prompt, tools, and context; nothing is shared.
- A single dynamic workflow run on a large codebase can consume millions of tokens in minutes.

### The rule: exhaust sequential and targeted parallel options first

Before triggering a dynamic workflow, confirm ALL of these are true:
1. The task genuinely cannot be decomposed into a small (≤5) set of targeted subtasks.
2. Manual fan-out via the `Agent` tool would require >20 independent agents to be useful.
3. The cost has been acknowledged by the user or the orchestrator has explicit budget authorization.
4. No simpler approach (grep, read, targeted search, sequential agents) can answer the question.

If even one of these is false: **do not use dynamic workflows**.

### When dynamic workflows ARE appropriate
- Finding bugs or patterns across a very large codebase (100+ files) where targeted search misses cross-file interactions.
- Large-scale refactors or migrations that genuinely affect every file.
- Stress-testing / adversarial verification at scale before a major release.
- Long-running work where hours of compute are authorized and budgeted.

### What to use instead (in order of preference)
1. **Read + Grep + targeted search** — covers 90% of codebase exploration.
2. **Agent tool with 2–5 focused subagents** — covers most parallel analysis needs.
3. **Sequential specialist agents** — orchestrator → architect → engineer chain.
4. **Dynamic workflows** — only when the above have been tried and are insufficient.

### Cost estimation before triggering
Always estimate before launching:
```
Estimated subagents: N
Avg context per subagent: ~X tokens
Model: <model>
Estimated cost: N × X × (price/MTok) ≈ $Y
```
If the estimate exceeds $5 for a single workflow run, require explicit user authorization before proceeding.

## Cortex Memory Architecture — How It Actually Works

Three surfaces, two stores, one sync queue. Know what each one is before writing to it.

```
SESSION START (session_start.py hook)
  → loads: anchored memories + hot memories (heat ≥ 0.4) + latest checkpoint
  → injects as Markdown block into context (progressive disclosure)
  → this IS the "system memory" equivalent — pinned at spawn

DURING SESSION
  ├── LOCAL FS  ~/.claude/memories/<scope>/   ← synchronous, authoritative
  │     ├── checkpoint.md                      ← overwrite as task progresses
  │     ├── notes.md                           ← constraints, rejected approaches
  │     └── scope-history.md                  ← scope deltas received mid-task
  │
  └── .pending-sync/ queue                    ← async bridge to Cortex DB
        (every memory-tool.sh write enqueues a job here)

CORTEX DB (PostgreSQL + pgvector)             ← eventually consistent replica
  ├── cortex:remember → writes episodic/semantic memories with embeddings
  ├── cortex:recall   → hybrid WRRF retrieval (vector + FTS + heat + recency)
  └── fed by drain-sync from .pending-sync queue (local FS is authoritative)

SESSION END (session_lifecycle.py hook)
  → records session stats
  → runs dream cycle: <5 turns=decay; 5-20=decay+compress; >20=full CLS replay
  → this is the consolidation step — episodic → semantic promotion

COMPACTION (compaction_checkpoint.py hook — fires automatically)
  → saves hippocampal checkpoint before context compaction
  → increments epoch, runs cascade advancement
  → you do NOT need to manually checkpoint at compaction — it happens
```

### The two stores and their relationship

**Local FS** (`~/.claude/memories/<scope>/`) is the fast, synchronous write surface. Every `tools/memory-tool.sh create` or `str_replace` is immediately durable. This is your working memory — the place to write decisions, state, and checkpoints during a task.

**Cortex DB** (PostgreSQL/pgvector) is the semantic search surface. It is an eventually-consistent replica of local FS, fed via the `.pending-sync` queue. When you call `cortex:recall`, you are querying the DB. When you call `cortex:remember` directly, you bypass local FS and write straight to the DB. The two stores converge but are not identical at any given moment.

**Rule**: Write task-state to local FS (`memory-tool.sh create`). The sync queue will replicate it to Cortex DB asynchronously. Do not verify a local write via `cortex:recall` — the sync queue may not have drained yet. Use `memory-tool.sh view` to verify local writes.

### What "system memory" means here

The Cortex session_start hook injects hot+anchored memories and the latest checkpoint into context at spawn. This is the pinned layer — it is loaded once and cached. The agent `.md` file (this file) is also loaded once and cached as the system prompt.

**Neither should be modified mid-session.** Modifying the system prompt mid-session busts the KV cache (full context reload cost). Hot memory injection at session start is handled by the hook — not by the agent.

**Opus 4.8 exception**: Mid-conversation `"system"` role messages (injected by the harness/orchestrator) are cache-safe incremental updates that do not modify the top-level system prompt. Use these for token-budget updates, permission changes, and scope narrowing. You receive them; you do not send them.

### What to write where

| Situation | Write to | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Task progress, current state, next action | `/memories/<scope>/checkpoint.md` | `memory-tool.sh create/str_replace` |
| Rejected approach or confirmed constraint | `/memories/<scope>/notes.md` | `memory-tool.sh create/str_replace` |
| Mid-task scope change received | `/memories/<scope>/scope-history.md` | `memory-tool.sh create` |
| Insight worth surfacing across ALL future sessions | `cortex:remember` directly (tags, agent_topic) | MCP tool |
| Cross-session architecture or design knowledge | Wiki (`cortex:wiki_write`) | MCP tool |
| Cross-agent lesson | Propose to orchestrator — you cannot write `/memories/lessons/` | — |

### Cortex recall vs memory-tool.sh search

| Surface | Command | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `memory-tool.sh view` | `view /memories/<scope>/file.md` | Known path — deterministic, fast |
| `memory-tool.sh search` | `search "<query>" --scope <name>` | Known keyword, unknown file |
| `cortex:recall` | MCP tool, query string | Conceptual/semantic retrieval across sessions |

Never use `cortex:recall` to verify a write you just made. It is async. Use `memory-tool.sh view`.

### Wiki vs memory

Wiki (`cortex:wiki_write`, `wiki_read`) is a **separate durable documentation surface** — markdown files at `~/.claude/methodology/wiki/` backed by `wiki.pages` table. It is never pruned. Use it for ADRs, specs, and long-form reference. It is NOT memory — it does not decay, does not have heat scores, and is not subject to dream-cycle consolidation. Wiki pages are indexed back into memory as protected pointer entries so `recall` can surface them, but the wiki itself lives outside the memory lifecycle.

### Isolation rules — preventing cross-contamination and context poisoning

Two contamination vectors exist. Both must be actively guarded against.

#### Vector 1 — cortex:recall without agent_topic (DB-level)

`cortex:recall(query="X")` searches the entire Cortex DB across all agents,
all sessions, all domains. If agent A wrote a stale checkpoint or a wrong
decision to Cortex, agent B's unscoped recall can surface it mid-task and
poison its reasoning.

**Rule: always scope cortex:recall to your own agent_topic for task-specific queries.**

```python
# WRONG — surfaces any agent's memories matching the query
cortex:recall(query="payment refund logic")

# CORRECT — scoped to this agent's memories only
cortex:recall(query="payment refund logic", agent_topic="<your-agent-topic>")
```

When is an unscoped recall appropriate?
- Explicitly seeking cross-agent context (e.g., "what did the architect decide about X?")
- Retrieving shared project decisions from `/memories/project/` or `/memories/lessons/`
- Looking up wiki documentation

Even then: review retrieved cross-agent memories critically. A different agent's
reasoning, checkpoint state, or rejected approach is not ground truth for your task.

#### Vector 2 — memory-tool.sh search without scope (FS-level)

`tools/memory-tool.sh search "<query>"` without `--scope` greps ALL scopes.
Genius agents share one `/memories/genius/` scope — a search there returns
files from all 98 genius agents unless filtered to a subpath.

**Rule: always pass `--scope <your-scope>` and filter to your subpath.**

```bash
# WRONG — returns files from all genius agents
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=feynman tools/memory-tool.sh search "rederivation" --scope genius

# CORRECT — scoped to this genius agent's subpath
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=feynman tools/memory-tool.sh search "rederivation" --scope genius
# then filter results to /memories/genius/feynman/ paths only

# BETTER — use view on your known path directly
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=feynman tools/memory-tool.sh view /memories/genius/feynman/
```

#### Promotion path — the only legitimate cross-agent memory flow

Agent memory stays isolated until explicitly promoted. Promotion is always
mediated by the orchestrator or curator:

```
Agent local FS (/memories/<scope>/)
  ↓  agent writes decision/lesson to its own scope
  ↓  signals orchestrator: "this is worth sharing"
Orchestrator reviews
  ↓  writes to /memories/lessons/ or /memories/project/
  ↓  (ACL blocks direct agent writes to lessons/)
Shared scope — readable by all agents
```

Do NOT use `cortex:remember(is_global=True)` to bypass this flow. Global
memories surface in every agent's unscoped recall — this is the fastest path
to context poisoning at scale.

#### Summary checklist before any memory read

- [ ] Using `memory-tool.sh view` with an explicit path → safe
- [ ] Using `memory-tool.sh search --scope <my-scope>` → safe
- [ ] Using `cortex:recall` with `agent_topic=<my-topic>` → safe
- [ ] Using `cortex:recall` without agent_topic for a task-specific query → **stop, add filter**
- [ ] Using `cortex:remember(is_global=True)` for task state → **stop, use local FS instead**
