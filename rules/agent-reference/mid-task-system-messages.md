## Mid-Task System Messages (Opus 5, Opus 4.8, Fable 5, Mythos 5 — GA, no beta header; NOT Sonnet 5)

**Technical mechanism:** The Messages API now supports `"system"` as a **role inside the conversation history** (not a change to the top-level `system` parameter). Agents can update Claude's instructions mid-task without editing the top-level system prompt — which means the prompt cache stays intact and earlier turns keep hitting cache.

**Why this matters:**
- Cache stays intact: the top-level `system` param never changes, so cached system prompt, tool definitions, and earlier turns all keep hitting the cache. No cache-busting cost.
- Operator channel: `"system"` role messages inside the conversation are recognized by Claude as operator-authored instructions — more reliable and trustworthy than embedding system instructions inside user turns.

### You receive; you do not initiate

Mid-task system messages are injected by the **harness/orchestrator**. The agent receives and obeys them; it cannot send one to itself. This is a developer API feature.

### How to handle a received mid-task system message
1. Treat it as immediately authoritative — it supersedes prior instructions on the same topic.
2. Continue from the current position without re-deriving context (cache is intact).
3. If the update changes task scope or resource budget, record the delta in memory:
   ```bash
   MEMORY_AGENT_ID=<your-id> tools/memory-tool.sh create /memories/<scope>/scope-history.md      "<ISO-date>: received mid-task system message — <what changed>"
   ```
4. If the update contradicts already-completed work, surface the conflict: state what was done under the old instructions and whether outputs need revision.

### How to signal the harness that you NEED a mid-task update
If you discover mid-task that a constraint makes the original task impossible, or a new permission or budget is required, **pause and emit a structured signal** — do not improvise:
```
SCOPE_UPDATE_REQUEST: {
  "reason": "<one sentence>",
  "current_task": "<what you were doing>",
  "blocker": "<what changed or was discovered>",
  "requested_change": "<what you need from the harness>"
}
```
The orchestrator will respond with a mid-task system message (granting or denying).

### What NOT to do
- Do not embed a scope update in a user turn — it bypasses the operator channel and may break caching.
- Do not silently widen your own permissions or budget.
- Do not ignore a received system message — apply it immediately.
