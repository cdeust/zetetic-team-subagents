Patch 8: Add cross-contamination prevention to <memory-architecture>.

The current architecture has two contamination vectors:
1. cortex:recall without agent_topic searches the ENTIRE Cortex DB —
   an agent can accidentally surface another agent's stale checkpoint
   or wrong decision mid-task.
2. .pending-sync tags memories with agent:<id> but cortex:recall
   has no default filter — broad queries return cross-agent results.

Fix: inject a "Isolation rules" block into every agent's
<memory-architecture> section, and make the agent-specific <memory>
section's recall commands always carry agent_topic.

Also: genius agents share one scope (/memories/genius/) with subpath
convention only — meaning memory-tool.sh search --scope genius returns
ALL genius agents' files. Agents must always pass their subpath explicitly.

### Isolation rules — preventing cross-contamination and context poisoning

Two contamination vectors exist. Both must be actively guarded against.

#### Vector 1 — cortex:recall without agent_topic (DB-level)

`cortex:recall(query="X")` searches the entire Cortex DB across all agents,
all sessions, all domains. If agent A wrote a stale checkpoint or a wrong
decision to Cortex, agent B's unscoped recall can surface it mid-task and
poison its reasoning.

**Rule: always scope cortex:recall to your own agent_topic for task-specific queries.**

```python
# WRONG — surfaces any agent's memories matching the query
cortex:recall(query="payment refund logic")

# CORRECT — scoped to this agent's memories only
cortex:recall(query="payment refund logic", agent_topic="<your-agent-topic>")
```

When is an unscoped recall appropriate?
- Explicitly seeking cross-agent context (e.g., "what did the architect decide about X?")
- Retrieving shared project decisions from `/memories/project/` or `/memories/lessons/`
- Looking up wiki documentation

Even then: review retrieved cross-agent memories critically. A different agent's
reasoning, checkpoint state, or rejected approach is not ground truth for your task.

#### Vector 2 — memory-tool.sh search without scope (FS-level)

`tools/memory-tool.sh search "<query>"` without `--scope` greps ALL scopes.
Genius agents share one `/memories/genius/` scope — a search there returns
files from all 98 genius agents unless filtered to a subpath.

**Rule: always pass `--scope <your-scope>` and filter to your subpath.**

```bash
# WRONG — returns files from all genius agents
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=feynman tools/memory-tool.sh search "rederivation" --scope genius

# CORRECT — scoped to this genius agent's subpath
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=feynman tools/memory-tool.sh search "rederivation" --scope genius
# then filter results to /memories/genius/feynman/ paths only

# BETTER — use view on your known path directly
MEMORY_AGENT_ID=feynman tools/memory-tool.sh view /memories/genius/feynman/
```

#### Promotion path — the only legitimate cross-agent memory flow

Agent memory stays isolated until explicitly promoted. Promotion is always
mediated by the orchestrator or curator:

```
Agent local FS (/memories/<scope>/)
  ↓  agent writes decision/lesson to its own scope
  ↓  signals orchestrator: "this is worth sharing"
Orchestrator reviews
  ↓  writes to /memories/lessons/ or /memories/project/
  ↓  (ACL blocks direct agent writes to lessons/)
Shared scope — readable by all agents
```

Do NOT use `cortex:remember(is_global=True)` to bypass this flow. Global
memories surface in every agent's unscoped recall — this is the fastest path
to context poisoning at scale.

#### Summary checklist before any memory read

- [ ] Using `memory-tool.sh view` with an explicit path → safe
- [ ] Using `memory-tool.sh search --scope <my-scope>` → safe
- [ ] Using `cortex:recall` with `agent_topic=<my-topic>` → safe
- [ ] Using `cortex:recall` without agent_topic for a task-specific query → **stop, add filter**
- [ ] Using `cortex:remember(is_global=True)` for task state → **stop, use local FS instead**
