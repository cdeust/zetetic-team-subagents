pii-daemon.py — Persistent PII-scan server for memory-tool.sh §7.2

Architecture decision (profile-driven):
  Profiling on 2026-04-24 showed interpreter cold-start = 37.1 ms on macOS,
  while scan logic (json_load + compile + scan_loop) = 1.3 ms.  The 37 ms
  cold-start exceeds the 50 ms write-path target when combined with other
  per-write overheads.  A persistent daemon eliminates cold-start entirely:
  after the first request the amortised cost per scan is ~1 ms (socket I/O
  + scan loop).  Option B (bash grep port) was rejected because it cannot
  reproduce the Shannon-entropy cross-check.  Option D (threshold skip) was
  rejected because the 3% optimisation target is interpreter startup, not
  content-size skipping.
  Source for timing: memory/pii-profile.md

Protocol (newline-delimited over AF_UNIX stream socket):
  Client → daemon: one JSON object followed by newline.
    { "content": "<utf8 text>", "strict": <bool> }
  Daemon → client: one JSON object followed by newline.
    { "result": "pass" | "blocked:<rule_id>" | "pii_scan_error" }
  Framing invariant: exactly one response line per request line.

Lifecycle:
  - Started on-demand by memory-tool.sh when socket absent or stale.
  - Accepts connections until IDLE_TIMEOUT seconds pass with no request.
  - SIGTERM / SIGINT: flush + remove socket + exit cleanly.
  - Stale socket cleanup: daemon writes its PID into a sidecar .pid file;
    the shell launcher checks the PID before deciding to restart.

Correctness invariants (identical to pii-scanner.py §7.2 contract):
  - Matched bytes NEVER written to any output — only rule IDs.
  - MEMORY_PII_SCAN_DISABLE=1 → result "pii_scan_disabled" (checked at
    request time so live env-var changes take effect without daemon restart).
  - MEMORY_PII_STRICT=1 → include low-confidence rules (email, phone).
  - Scanner errors → result "pii_scan_error" (caller allows write).
  - Rules are compiled once at daemon start; JSON re-read if rules file
    mtime changes (hot-reload without restart).

Complexity analysis:
  Per-request scan: O(R × N) where R = number of enabled rules (≤14) and
  N = input length in characters.  re.search on CPython uses a DFA/NFA
  hybrid; worst-case is O(R × N) but average on benign text is sub-linear
  because most patterns anchor on rare byte sequences.  The entropy check
  is O(M) where M = length of matched group (bounded by pattern).
  Total per-request: O(14N) ≈ O(N).  At N = 10 KB this is ~140 K steps —
  well within 1 ms on modern hardware (confirmed by profiling above).

    ~0.1 ms per call.  Explicit pre-compilation removes that cost and makes
    the hot path a pure re.search over already-compiled objects.

    CORRECTNESS: if the rules file is modified while the daemon is running
    (hot-reload), the caller detects the mtime change and calls this function
    again.  The two lists (_compiled_high, _compiled_all) are replaced
