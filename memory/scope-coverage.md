# Memory Scope Coverage Map

**Companion to:** `memory/scope-registry.json` v2 and `memory/ADR-001-scope-coverage.md`.
**Purpose:** authoritative agent-slug → scope mapping. Refactorer uses this to set `memory_scope:` frontmatter on every agent.
**Last updated:** 2026-04-24

## Conventions

- **Agent slug** = the agent's filename without `.md` (e.g. `agents/engineer.md` → slug `engineer`).
- **Role** = `owner` (write+read) or `reader` (read-only) for that scope.
- **Subpath convention** = where within the scope the agent SHOULD write its files. For team agents this is the scope root (`/memories/<scope>/`). For genius agents this is `/memories/genius/<slug>/` — the convention is mandatory but enforced by description text, not ACL (see ADR-001).

## Systemic scopes (no agent owns these by slug)

| Scope | Owners | Readers | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `global` | `_user`, `_curator` | `*` | Cross-project ground truth. Curator-only writes. |
| `lessons` | `_user`, `_curator` | `*` | Rules from corrections. `orchestrator` writes via `_curator` role. |
| `quarantine` | `*` | `_user`, `_curator` | Untrusted-source writes. Triage-only reads. |
| `session` | `*` | `*` | Ephemeral scratch. TTL 1 day. |
| `project` | `*` | `*` | Per-project durable context. TTL 90 days. |
| `checkpoints` | `*` | `*` | Context-cap / compaction checkpoints (token-budget protocol). Any agent may checkpoint. TTL 30 days. |
| `reviewer-prefs` | `_user`, `orchestrator` | `engineer`, `refactorer`, `code-reviewer` | Team lead's standing review preferences (CAP-2). Lead/curator-only writes so agents can't invent prefs; never overrides a coding-standards.md blocking rule. Per-lead subpath `/memories/reviewer-prefs/<lead>/`. No TTL; 50 KB/file. |

## Team agents — per-agent scopes (18 entries)

Every team agent owns exactly one scope keyed by its slug. Subpath: `/memories/<slug>/`.

| Agent slug | `memory_scope` | Owner of | Reader of (besides own) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `architect` | `architect` | `architect` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `code-reviewer` | `code-reviewer` | `code-reviewer` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `data-scientist` | `data-scientist` | `data-scientist` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `dba` | `dba` | `dba` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `devops-engineer` | `devops-engineer` | `devops-engineer` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `engineer` | `engineer` | `engineer` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `frontend-engineer` | `frontend-engineer` | `frontend-engineer` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `latex-engineer` | `latex-engineer` | `latex-engineer` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `mlops` | `mlops` | `mlops` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `orchestrator` | `orchestrator` | `orchestrator` + curator role on `global`, `lessons` | all `*`-readable scopes + curator-only readers |
| `paper-writer` | `paper-writer` | `paper-writer` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `professor` | `professor` | `professor` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `refactorer` | `refactorer` | `refactorer` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `reviewer-academic` | `reviewer-academic` | `reviewer-academic` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `security-auditor` | `security-auditor` | `security-auditor` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `simplifier` | `simplifier` | `simplifier` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `test-engineer` | `test-engineer` | `test-engineer` | all `*`-readable scopes |
| `ux-designer` | `ux-designer` | `ux-designer` | all `*`-readable scopes |

## Team agents — shared `research` scope (2 entries)

Co-authored by design (research pipeline). Subpath: `/memories/research/`.

| Agent slug | `memory_scope` | Owner of | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `experiment-runner` | `research` | `research` | shared with research-scientist |
| `research-scientist` | `research` | `research` | shared with experiment-runner |

## Genius agents — shared `genius` scope (97 entries)

All genius agents share scope `genius`. Per-agent isolation is by **mandatory subpath convention**: `/memories/genius/<slug>/`. Cross-genius reads are permitted (cross-pollination is the design intent).

`memory_scope: genius` on every entry below. Owner of `genius`. Reader of all `*`-readable scopes. Subpath: `/memories/genius/<slug>/`.

> **NOTE:** `agents/genius/INDEX.md` is not an agent — it is the directory index. It does not get a `memory_scope` and does not count toward the 97.

## Coverage summary

| Category | Count | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Team agents (excl. genius) | 20 | 20 / 20 = 100% |
| Genius agents | 97 | 97 / 97 = 100% |
| **Total agents** | **117** | **100%** |
| Distinct registry scopes | 27 | (7 systemic + 18 team + 1 research + 1 genius) |

> **Why this total (117) is one less than the README's agent count (118):** this doc
> tabulates only **scope-owning** agents. `memory-writer` is a budgeted scribe that
> writes into its *parent's* scope and owns none — it has an `agent_topic` but no
> `memory_scope` and no `scope-registry.json` entry, so it is intentionally excluded
> from the tables above. The README/marketplace counts enumerate agent definition
> files (which include `memory-writer`), hence 118. Both are correct for what they
> count.

## Seeding `reviewer-prefs` from a lead's history (CAP-2)

A lead need not hand-author their preferences from scratch. The orchestrator/curator
(an owner of the scope) MAY bootstrap `/memories/reviewer-prefs/<lead>/` from
**evidence of how the lead already works** — their prior PR review comments and their
merged PRs. The tool `tools/seed-reviewer-prefs.sh <lead>` does the gathering: it
collects the lead's review comments and merged PRs via `gh` and emits a
provenance-tagged `status: inferred` draft (dry-run by default; `--write` persists it
as an owner). This gives a first-pass glimpse the lead can then correct, rather than a
blank file. The tool deliberately does NOT invent abstract preferences (§9 — faking
judgment): it presents the raw evidence; abstracting it into stated, confirmed
preferences is the orchestrator/lead's judgment step.

Discipline (zetetic §8 — every pref traces to evidence):
- **Owner-only writes.** Seeding is done by `_user` or `orchestrator`, never by a
  reviewed agent (engineer/refactorer/code-reviewer are readers only). The ACL
  guarantees this; seeding does not relax it.
- **Provenance per pref.** Each seeded preference cites the PR number / review comment
  it was inferred from. An unsourced "preference" is a guess, not a pref.
- **Mark inferred vs. confirmed.** Seeded prefs are `status: inferred` until the lead
  confirms them; a reviewed agent applies a confirmed pref as binding and an inferred
  pref as a COMMENT-level suggestion. Inference never escalates to a blocking rule.
- **Never overrides coding-standards.md.** A mined pattern that conflicts with a hard
  rule is discarded, not encoded.

## Refactorer checklist

For every agent file under `agents/`:

1. Read the agent's filename slug.
2. Look up the slug in this document.
3. Set frontmatter `memory_scope: <scope>` to the value in the table.
4. For genius agents, additionally document the subpath convention in the agent's `<memory>` section: "Write under `/memories/genius/<slug>/`."
5. Commit per-agent (one frontmatter change per commit) so blast radius stays scoped.

## Adding a new agent (post-rollout)

1. Decide: team agent or genius?
2. **Team agent:** add a new scope entry to `scope-registry.json` keyed by the slug, owners `[<slug>, "_user"]`, readers `["*"]`, ttl_days 30, max_file_kb 100. Add a row to the team table above. Set agent frontmatter `memory_scope: <slug>`.
3. **Genius agent:** no registry change needed. Add a row to the genius table above. Set agent frontmatter `memory_scope: genius`. Document subpath in agent's `<memory>` section.
4. Open a PR; require curator review (orchestrator or `_user`).

## Verification

```bash
python3 -c 'import json; d=json.load(open("memory/scope-registry.json")); print("scopes=", len(d["scopes"]), "strict=", d["strict_unknown_scope"], "curators=", d["curator_agents"])'
```

Expected: `scopes= 26 strict= True curators= ['_user', 'orchestrator']`
